AdTiles Template
--------------------
This is a highly customizable and very easy to use AdTiles template.

**Required Assets**

Video player needs a poster and MP4/WEBM/OGV format video file (it is recommended to have more than one video file type). Background images for panels can be set through additional assets.

### How to assign additional assets ###

Select `File Browser` panel from the left side of the screen. Then, click on settings icon next to the title `Additional assets`. 

Additional assets should be assigned in the following order:

* Video files ( MP4/WEBM/OGV formats) should be assigned as first assets.
* Video poster should be assigned below video files.
* Background images for panels (optional).

**Backup image**

In case the browser is outdated and doesn't support HTML5, the backup panel image will be shown and clickTAGBackup will be used for the landing page.

To set up a backup image, open `Banner settings` panel by clicking on the settings icon placed at the top-left corner of the screen. Upload your backup file by clicking on `Upload image` button placed at the bottom of the panel. 

### Changing dimensions ###

Navigate to `Banner Settings` panel.  In the `Dimensions` section enter new values for the collapsed banner (the initial collapsed panel expands down and reveals another same size panel) and for the expanded banner (when all panels are expanded). When done, click `Save button` at the top of the screen or hit `Ctrl + S`.

### How set AdTiles options ###

In order to edit AdTiles settings, you have to refer to [PanelFlip Documentation](http://support.adform.com/documentation/build-html5-banners/adform-html5-api-components/panel-flip-component).
